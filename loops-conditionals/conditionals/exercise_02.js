/*
  Problem: With this structure of multiple separate "if" statements, the code will print 
  "You are in elementary school, kid." when age is 3 or higher, without evaluating the other 
  conditions (13 and 18), because each "if" is independent.
  Solution: Change to "else if" after the first "if" to ensure that only one condition is evaluated 
  and the correct message is printed based on the value of "age".
